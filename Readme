This is a very simple Linked List implementation.

include "linkedList.h"

init() initializes the head node of the linked list

cleanup() iteratively frees each node in the linked list and frees head last

createNewNode(int name, int value) adds a new node with name and value to the linked list

getLinkedListLength() will return the length of the linked list

printLinkedList() will print each element of the linked list
